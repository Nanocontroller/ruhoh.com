## Installing/Upgrading

```` bash
$ gem install ruhoh --version '0.3.0'
````

## Better Markdown Parsing

I've switched to [Redcarpet](https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet) from maruku which is faster and more feature-rich.

You can now do fenced-code-blocks and links will linkify themselves automatically.

## Plugin System Released

[Ruhoh's full-featured plugin documentation now available](/usage/plugins).

### Contributing Plugins

Feel free to add your plugins to the [Ruhoh Wiki](https://github.com/ruhoh/ruhoh.rb/wiki).
You can define them inline, as a gist, a blog post, link to repo, whatever you want.
I'll be on the lookout and find a way to get them onto the official website. Thanks!
